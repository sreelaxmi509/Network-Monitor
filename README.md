NetworkMonitor: Comprehensive Network Monitoring Tool

Introduction:
NetworkMonitor is an advanced tool designed for real-time monitoring and analysis of network traffic. As modern networks become increasingly complex, the need for reliable and efficient monitoring solutions has never been greater. NetworkMonitor provides a comprehensive suite of features that allow users to track network performance, identify potential issues, and ensure the overall health and security of their network infrastructure.
Whether you're a network administrator, cybersecurity professional, or IT enthusiast, NetworkMonitor equips you with the necessary tools to gain deep insights into network behavior, enabling proactive management and swift resolution of network-related issues.

Working:
NetworkMonitor operates through a multi-layered approach, focusing on capturing, analyzing, and reporting network data.

Data Capture:
NetworkMonitor listens to network traffic across specified interfaces, capturing packets in real-time.
It collects detailed information about each packet, including source and destination IP addresses, protocols, port numbers, and packet size.

Data Analysis:
Captured data is analyzed to identify patterns, trends, and anomalies within the network traffic.
NetworkMonitor can detect abnormal activities such as unusually high traffic, potential security threats, and network bottlenecks.
The tool also provides detailed breakdowns of bandwidth usage, helping administrators optimize network performance.

Reporting and Alerts:
NetworkMonitor generates comprehensive reports that provide insights into network performance and potential issues.
Users can set up alerts for specific network events, such as a spike in traffic or the detection of suspicious activity, allowing for immediate action.

Features:
Real-Time Monitoring: Continuously monitors network traffic with low latency.
Detailed Reporting: Generates in-depth reports on network performance, traffic patterns, and potential issues.
Customizable Alerts: Allows users to define specific conditions under which alerts are triggered.
